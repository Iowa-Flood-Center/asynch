Contributing to Asynch
======================

You are here to help on Asynch? Awesome, feel welcome and read the
following sections in order to know what and how to work on something. If you
get stuck at any point you can create a `ticket on GitHub`_.

Contributing to development
---------------------------

If you want to deep dive and help out with development on Read the Docs, then
first get the project installed locally according to the
:ref:`Installation Guide <installing-read-the-docs>`. After that is done we
suggest you have a look at tickets in our issue tracker that are labelled `Good
First Bug`_. These are meant to be a great way to get a smooth start and
won't put you in front of the most complex parts of the system.

If you are up to more challenging tasks with a bigger scope, then there are a
set of tickets with a `Enhancement`_ tag. These tickets have a general
overview and description of the work required to finish. If you want to start
somewhere, this would be a good place to start. That said, these aren't
necessarily the easiest tickets. They are simply things that are explained. If
you still didn't find something to work on, search for the `Sprintable`_
label. Those tickets are meant to be standalone and can be worked on ad-hoc.

When contributing code, then please follow the standard Contribution
Guidelines set forth at `contribution-guide.org`_.
