C API
=====

ASYNCH comes with a collection of routines to access specific details of the underlying solver structure. This allows a user to construct his or her own programs, while making calls to the solver in particular ways. This is useful for modifying how the solvers behave, and for producing more specialized outputs. A user can also specify his or her own models in a separate module. Currently, interface routines exist for the C/C++ and Python programming languages.

Typical Interface Usage
-----------------------

In this section, we provide an overview of how to use the API routines for running simulations. Regardless of the language, the general order of calling API routines is the same. Further routines may be added to increase flexibility.

A basic program that uses the ASYNCH solvers to perform calculations and takes advantage of all the features of a global file is the following (written in C):

.. code-block:: c

  //Make sure we finalize MPI
  void asynch_onexit(void)
  {
      int flag;
      MPI_Finalized(&flag);
      if (!flag)
          MPI_Finalize();
  }

  int main(int argc,char* argv[])
  {
    int res;
    char *global_filename = argv[1];

    //Initialize MPI stuff
    res = MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    if (res == MPI_SUCCESS)
        atexit(asynch_onexit);
    else
    {
        print_err("Failed to initialize MPI");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    //Init asynch object and the river network
    AsynchSolver asynch;
    Asynch_Init(&asynch, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
    Asynch_Parse_GBL(&asynch, global_filename);
    Asynch_Load_Network(&asynch);
    Asynch_Partition_Network(&asynch);
    Asynch_Load_Network_Parameters(&asynch, 0);
    Asynch_Load_Dams(&asynch);
    Asynch_Load_Numerical_Error_Data(&asynch);
    Asynch_Initialize_Model(&asynch);
    Asynch_Load_Initial_Conditions(&asynch);
    Asynch_Load_Forcings(&asynch);
    Asynch_Load_Save_Lists(&asynch);
    Asynch_Finalize_Network(&asynch);
    Asynch_Calculate_Step_Sizes(&asynch);

    //Prepare output files
    Asynch_Prepare_Temp_Files(&asynch);
    Asynch_Write_Current_Step(&asynch);
    Asynch_Prepare_Peakflow_Output(&asynch);
    Asynch_Prepare_Output(&asynch);

    //Perform the calculations
    Asynch_Advance(&asynch, 1);

    //Create output files
    Asynch_Take_System_Snapshot(&asynch, NULL);
    Asynch_Create_Output(&asynch, NULL);
    Asynch_Create_Peakflows_Output(&asynch);

    //Clean up
    Asynch_Delete_Temporary_Files(&asynch);
    Asynch_Free(&asynch);

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
  }

Details of each function call can be found in Section [sec: user interface routines].

The program begins by initializing the asynchsolver object. The MPI communicator consisting of all processes (:code:`MPI_COMM_WORLD`) is used for the calculations. Next, the global file specified as a command line argument to the program is parsed. Based upon the information specified by the global file, the different components of the network are constructed.

Next, the outputs for the program are initialized. The files for holding calculation results while the program runs is initialized (i.e. the temporary files). The initial values of the states are written to disk. Any initializations needed for the output peakflow and output time series sources are done.

With a call to :code:`Asynch_Advance`, the calculations are performed. Any time series results are temporarily stored in the temporary files.

Once the calculations are complete, any necessary outputs are created (snapshot, output time series, output peakflow data). This could include writing to files or database tables, depending upon the options selected in the global file.

Lastly, clean up routines are called. The temporary files are deleted. The asynchsolver object is also deleted from memory with a call to . Note that this routine does not need to be called if using the interface functions from a language that supports automatic garbage collection.

Of course, outputting more information might be useful (timing results, command line parameter checking, results printed to screen, etc), and additional features may be needed (outputting data to multiple sources, creating peakflow data over intervals of time, etc). However, this is the basic structure needed to perform simulations. The source files *asynchdist.c* and *asynchdist.py* are essentially duplicates of the above program, but with information printed to screen.

User Interface Routines
-----------------------

In this section, routines for operating the solver are described. These routines can be used to create an instance of an ASYNCH solver, and manipulate properties such as total simulation time, when data output occurs, etc... Creation of custom outputs is discussed in Section [sec: custom outputs] and creation of custom models is discussed in Section [sec: custom-models].

The point where the pointer is moved is determined by *set_value*, which is in the output series determined by *output_idx*. The local time where the next data will be written for each link is *set_time*.

A warning occurs if *set_value* is not found for a link, and that link’s tempfile pointer is not changed.

asynchsolver* asynch,
char* name)

-  Inputs

-  asynchsolver\* asynch: Pointer to the AsynchSolver object to use.

-  char\* name: The name of the peakflow output to check.

-  Return value

-  int: Returns 1 if the output *name* is set, 0 if it is not set, and -1 if it is not present.

::

Python Interface:

-  Inputs

-  name: The name of the peakflow output to check.

-  Return value

-  Returns 1 if the output *name* is set, 0 if it is not set, and -1 if it is not present.

This routine determines whether the peakflow output with name *name* is being used for the current simulations. If *name* is requested in the global file and has been set, the routine returns 1. If the *name* is requested in the global file, but has not yet been set, this routine returns 0. If *name* was not requested in the global file, the return value is -1. A peakflow output can be set with a call to *Asynch_Set_Peakflow_Output*. See Section [sec: asynch\ :sub:`s`\ et\ :sub:`p`\ eakflow\ :sub:`o`\ utput] for details about setting peakflow outputs.

This routine gets the filename of the output snapshot file. If a database connection is used, then the contents of *snapshotname* is not modified. The Python interface routine returns the string with the filename instead of taking it as an argument.

Asynch_Get_Size_Global_Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

asynchsolver* asynch)

::

Python Interface:
Get_Size_Global_Parameters()

-  Outputs

-  Returns the number of global parameters, typically specified in a global file.

This routine returns the number of parameters for the differential equations that are available to every link. This number is either specified in a global file, or with a call to the routine *Asynch_Set_Global_Parameters* (see Section [sec: asynch\ :sub:`s`\ et\ :sub:`g`\ lobal\ :sub:`p`\ arameters]).

Asynch_Get_Global_Parameters

asynchsolver* asynch,double* gparams)

-  Inputs

-  asynchsolver\* asynch: Pointer to the AsynchSolver object to use.

-  double\* gparams: Array to store the global parameters.

-  Outputs

-  int: Returns 1 if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.

::

Python Interface:
Get_Global_Parameters()

-  Outputs

-  Returns a list with two entries: A list containing the global parameters, and an integer with value 1 if an error occurred and 0 otherwise.

This routine gets the values of the global parameters. For the C function, the array *gparams* should contain enough memory to hold the global parameters. The number of global parameters can be determined with a call to *Asynch_Get_Size_Global_Parameters* (see Section [sec: asynch\ :sub:`g`\ et\ :sub:`s`\ ize\ :sub:`g`\ lobal\ :sub:`p`\ arameters]). The obtained values are a copy of Asynch’s internal values of the parameters, so modifying them will have no effect on the solver results.

Asynch_Set_Global_Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

C Interface:
int Asynch_Set_Global_Parameters(
asynchsolver* asynch,
double* gparams,
unsigned int n)

-  Inputs

-  asynchsolver\* asynch: Pointer to the AsynchSolver object to use.

::

Python Interface:
Set_Global_Parameters(gparams)

-  Inputs

-  gparams: List of global parameter values to set.

-  Outputs

-  Returns 1 if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.

This routine sets the values of the global parameters. The number of global parameters may be different from the number previously stored by Asynch. However, if the new global parameters should be consistent with the model equations at each link (for example, if the model at each hillslope expects 4 global parameters, using this routine to change the number of global parameters to 2 WILL cause an error). The values are copied from the array (or list) into Asynch’s internal memory. So changing their values after this function call will NOT change the solver results.

Custom Outputs
--------------

Time series outputs can be customized so as to produce results specific to a particular model. For instance, fluxes that are used internally to the model, or values that are not needed at all for computing state solutions, may be outputted.

To create a custom output, specify the name of your new output in the global file (see Section [sec: time series output]). Next, in your program after reading the global file but before performing simulations, call the routine *Asynch_Set_Output* to set your output. Then perform any calculations or further modifications as usual.

A custom routine must be provided by the user for determining how the output is calculated. The specifications for this function are provided below.

Similarly, custom peakflow outputs can be created. These are set with a call to the routine *Asynch_Set_Peakflow_Output*.

The routines for setting custom outputs are described below.

Asynch_Set_Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

C Interface:
int Asynch_Set_Output(
asynchsolver* asynch,

-  Return value

-  0 if the output is set, 1 if an error occurred.

This routine sets a custom output time series. A function is required that will be called every time output data is to be written for a link. The function set in this routine should have the specification:

::

C Interface:

-  iparams: The vector of integer parameters for the link.

-  state: The current state of the state vector.

-  user: User defined data.

-  Return value

-  Returns the data to be written as output.

*Asynch_Set_Output* must also be given an array *used_states*. This array contains the indices of the states in the state vectors which are needed by the user specified routine *func*. All states listed in this array are guaranteed to be available for the routine *func*. The Python version of this function should be of type *ASYNCH_OUTPUT_<output type>_DATATYPE*, with <output type> either *INT* or *DOUBLE*.

Asynch_Set_Peakflow_Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

C Interface:
int Asynch_Set_Peakflow_Output(
asynchsolver* asynch,
char* name,
void (*func)(unsigned int,double,VEC*,VEC*,
VEC*,double,unsigned int,void*,char*))

-  Inputs

-  asynchsolver\* asynch: Pointer to the AsynchSolver object to use.

-  char\* name: Name of the custom peakflow function.

-  void (\*func): Pointer to the routine to call when writing peakflow data for the custom output.

-  Inputs

-  name: Name of the custom peakflow function.

-  func: Routine to call when writing peakflow data for the custom output.

-  Return value

-  1 if the output is set, 0 if an error occurred.

This routine sets a custom peakflow function. A function is required that will be called every time peakflow data is to be written for a link. The function set in this routine should have the specification:

::

C Interface:
void func(unsigned int ID,
double peak_time,
VEC* peak_value,
VEC* params,
VEC* global_params,
double conversion,
unsigned int area_idx,
void* user,
char* buffer)

-  Inputs

-  unsigned int ID: Link ID of the link to write data.

-  double peak_time: The local time at which the peak flow was found.

-  VEC\* peak_value: The vector of states at the time when the peakflow was determined.

-  VEC\* params: The vector of parameters for the link.

-  VEC\* global_params: The vector of parameters uniform between all links.

-  double conversion: A unit conversion factor to apply to the upstream area, if desired.

-  char\* buffer: Buffer to write the output data.

::

Python Interface:
func(ID,peak_time,peak_value,params,global_params,
conversion,area_idx,user,outputbuffer)

-  Inputs

-  ID: Link ID of the link to write data.

-  peak_time: The local time at which the peak flow was found.

-  user: User defined data.

-  outputbuffer: String buffer to write the output data.

This user-defined function fills *outputbuffer* with the desired peakflow information. Whatever contents are placed into the output buffer will appear as a row or tuple in the final peakflow data. As an example, the following function is used when the peakflow function “Classic” is selected:

::

void OutputPeakflow_Classic_Format(unsigned int ID,
double peak_time,VEC* peak_value,VEC* params,
VEC* global_params,double conversion,
unsigned int area_idx,void* user,char* buffer)
{
sprintf(buffer,"%u %.4f %.8f %.8f\n",ID,
conversion*params->ve[area_idx],peak_time,
peak_value->ve[0]);
}

Each line of the output peakflow file will contain: link id, link upstream area (from the parameter list), the time to peak, and the value of the peakflow.

Custom Models
-------------

ASYNCH allows users to add their own models by modifying the routines described in Section [sec: model descriptions]. However, the ASYNCH user interface allows users to create their own routines to define a model, and pass them to the solvers. This allows users to create their own models without modifying the underlying solver code. This can be done with a call to the following routine:

::

C Interface:
int Asynch_Custom_Model(asynchsolver* asynch,
void (*SetParamSizes)(UnivVars*,void*),
void (*Convert)(VEC*,unsigned int,void*),
void (*Routines)(Link*,unsigned int,
unsigned int,unsigned short int,void*),
void (*Precalculations)(Link*,VEC*,VEC*,IVEC*,
unsigned int,unsigned int,unsigned short int,
unsigned int,void*),
unsigned int (*InitializeEqs)(VEC*,VEC*,IVEC*,
QVSData*,unsigned short int,VEC*,
unsigned int,void*))

-  Inputs

-  asynchsolver\* asynch: Pointer to the AsynchSolver object to use.

-  void (\*Routines): Routine to specify model routines.

-  void (\*Precalculations): Routine for model precalculations.

-  unsigned int (\*InitializeEqs): Routine to set initial conditions not determined through the global file.

-  Return Value

-  int: Returns 1 if an error occurred, 0 if the model was set successfully.

::

Python Interface:
Custom_Model(SetParamSizes,Convert,Routines,
Precalculations,InitializeEqs)

-  Convert: Routine to apply unit conversions to link parameters.

-  Precalculations: Routine for model precalculations.

-  InitializeEqs: Routine to set initial conditions not determined through the global file.

-  Return Value

-  Returns 1 if an error occurred, 0 if the model was set successfully.

The five routines needed to create a model are described in Section [sec: model definition]. The routines for the differential and algebraic equations are set in the *Routines* routine, and do not need to be passed through the *Asynch_Custom_Model* routine directly.

Structures and Objects
----------------------

Several structures are defined for the ASYNCH solvers, and are available for use in user routines. The exact structure definitions can be found in the source files:

C Interface
: structs.h and mathmethods.h

Python Interface
: asynch_py/asynch_interface.py

Below we provide a description of structures and their members which are useful for the user to manipulate. Other structures are defined, but not likely to be utilized by a typical user. Descriptions of these structures can be found in the source code. Although the C versions of the structures are given here, the structures are similar for other languages.

Vector and Matrix Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vectors and matrices have the following members:

-  VEC

-  double\* ve

-  unsigned int dim

-  IVEC

-  int\* ve

-  unsigned int dim

-  MAT

-  double\* array

-  double\*\* me

-  unsigned int m,n

For the two vector structures *VEC* and *IVEC*, the array of *dim* vector elements is stored in the member *ve*. Similarly, the matrix structure *MAT* has its *m* by *n* elements stored in the member *me*. The elements of a *MAT* object can also be accessed linearly through the member *array*.

Typical users of ASYNCH will only need to modify elements of existing vectors (if that). Developers may need to use these structures more heavily. Routines for creating, destroying, and performing operations on vectors and matrices can be found in the source code *mathmethods.c*.

UnivVars Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A single instance of a universal variables structure is maintained by the ASYNCH solver. This object holds much of the information that describes the general structure of the network. A user who creates a custom model will need to set several members of the universal variables object. Below are the members a typical user may encounter. Many, many more members exist, and a developer is strongly encouraged to view these members in *structs.h*.

unsigned short int type
: The index for the model used

int iter_limit
: The maximum number of time steps stored per link

int max_transfer_steps
: Maximum number of steps to communicate at once between processes

double maxtime
: The final local time for the simulation

double t_0
: Initial local time to start integration

unsigned int dim
: The dimension of the state vectors at each link

unsigned int discont_size
: Size of discontinuity buffers at each link

unsigned int diff_start
: Starting index of differential variables in solution vectors

unsigned int no_ini_start
: Starting index of differential variables not read from disk

unsigned short int uses_dam
: 1 if this type can use dams, 0 else

VEC\* global_params
: List of global parameters

unsigned int params_size
: Size of params at each link without a dam

unsigned int iparams_size
: Size of iparams at each link

unsigned int dam_params_size
: Size of params at each link with a dam

unsigned int disk_params
: Number of parameters to read from disk

unsigned int area_idx
: Index of upstream area (A_i) in params

unsigned int areah_idx
: Index of hillslope area (A_h) in params

unsigned int num_dense
: Number of states where dense output is calculated

unsigned int\* dense_indices
: List of indices in solution where dense output is needed

unsigned short int convertarea_flag
: 1 if hillslope and upstream areas are converted from :math:`km^2` to :math:`m^2`, 0 if not

unsigned short int template_flag
: 1 if XML templates are to be used, 0 if not

unsigned int num_forcings
: The number forcings the model requires

Link Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every link in the network is represented by an instance of a link structure. Users developing their own models need to set a few members of each link. Many more members exist, and developers are recommended to view *structs.h*.

unsigned int ID
: The unique ID of the link

void \*f
: The function for evaluating an ODE

void \*alg
: The function for evaluating algebraic equations

int \*state_check
: The function to check the discontinuity state of the state variables (for discontinuities)

void \*Jacobian
: The function for evaluating the Jacobian matrix of an ODE

int \*RKSolver
: The routine for the Runge Kutta solver

void \*CheckConsistency
: The function that alters a state vector to be within the constraints of the ODEs

The requirements for what tasks each of these functions perform is covered in Section [sec: model equations definition]. Each function should take the following arguments:

-
-  void alg(VEC\*,VEC\*,VEC\*,QVSData\*,int,VEC\*)

-  int state_check(VEC\*,VEC\*,VEC\*,QVSData\*,unsigned int)

-  void Jacobian(double,VEC\*,VEC\*\*,unsigned short int,VEC\*, double\*,VEC\*,MAT\*)

-  int RKSolver(Link\*,UnivVars\*,int\*,short int,FILE\*, ConnData\*,Forcing\*\*,TempStorage\*)

-  void CheckConsistency(VEC\* y,VEC\* params,VEC\* global_params)

If these functions are set with the Python interface, and are written in Python, then each must be decorated as an appropriate data type. See Section [sec: api for python].
