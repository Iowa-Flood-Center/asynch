# ASYNCH

A numerical library for solving differential equations with a tree structure. Emphasis is given to hillslope-link river basin models.

## Documentation

The documentation is available [here](http://asynch.readthedocs.io/). Thank you to the people running Read the Docs for such an excellent service.

The source for the documentation is in the `docs` folder if you want to built it and read it locally.

## Testing

Asynch doesn't have a good test covergage at the moment but the unit test framework is in place.
