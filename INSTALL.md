## Standard Makefile Targets


 - `make all` Build programs, libraries, documentation, etc. (Same as `make`.)
 - `make install` Install what needs to be installed.
 - `make install-strip` Same as `make install`, then strip debugging symbols.
 - `make uninstall` The opposite of `make install`.
 - `make clean` Erase what has been built (the opposite of `make all`).
 - `make distclean` Additionally erase anything `./configure` created.
 - `make check` Run the test suite, if any.
 - `make installcheck` Check the installed programs or libraries, if supported.
 - `make dist` Create PACKAGE-VERSION.tar.gz.
